\subsection{Components and Local Connectedness}
\begin{ex}{25.1}
    What are the components and path components of $\R_l$? What are the continuous maps $f:\R\to\R_l$?
\end{ex}
\begin{sol}
    Let $A\subset\R_l$ be a connected subspace that is not empty and take $a\in A$. 
    Then $a\in A\cap [a,\infty)$ so $A\cap (-\infty, a)=\varnothing$ since $A$ is connected. 
    Choose any $b\in A$. Then $a\leq b$ but also $b\in A\cap [b,\infty)$ and $A\cap(-\infty, b)=\varnothing$ so $b\leq a$.
    It follows that $b=a$ and $A=\{a\}$. Therefore the only connected sets of $\R_l$ are singletons.
    Since any path component is a component, it follows that path components are singletons as well.

    Since the image of a connected space under a continuous map must be connected, the only continuous maps $f:\R\to\R_l$ are  constant functions.
